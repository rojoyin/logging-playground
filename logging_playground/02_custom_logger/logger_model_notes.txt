Create a Logger: logging.getLogger()
This will return a new instance of the logger we want to customize

handler: logging.StreamHandler() | logging.FileHandler("file.log") | logging.OtherHandler
Creates a specific function to handle logs, we set the min level of logs to be handled

formatter: logging.Formatter("[STRING-WITH-THE-FORMAT]")
The template to create the LogRecord instances that will be logged by the handler

An instance of a type Logger could have multiple handlers, each handler has one formatter

The order of creation is, bottom to top from the initial diagram:
- Create the formatter, according to the information you want to log
- Create the handler, setting the min level of events you want to log
- Attach a formatter to a specific handler
- Attach the handler to the specific logger instance
- Use the Logger instance
